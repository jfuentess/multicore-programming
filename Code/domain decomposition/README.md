# Domain decomposition strategy

Problems to be solved with the *domain decomposition strategy*. You can find three problems

* *Matrix multiplication*: Parallel computation of matrix multiplication for square matrices. For this problem, we present two algorithms based on matrix partitioning.
* *String matching*: Implementation of a parallel algorithm to solve the string matching problem
* *Wavelet matrix*: We present the problem of construct a wavelet tree in parallel. We discuss three parallel algorithm: recursive, per-level and domain decomposition. We provide a simple explanation of two of the algorithms [here](wt_presentation.pdf)

The details of each problem are available [here](problems.pdf)
