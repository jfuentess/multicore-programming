# Reduce pattern

Problems to be solved with the *reduce pattern*. You can find four problems

* *Minimum element*: Computation of the minimum element and the index of the minimum element of an array of integers
* *Dot product*: Parallel computation of the dot product of two integer arrays. To solve this problem, we present several alternatives (see [dot_product.cpp](dot_product.cpp)). To test of performance of each solution, run the bas script in [run_test.sh](run_test.sh)
* *DFS traversal*: Compute the DFS traversal of a binary tree by using the list reducer of Cilk Plus
* *Printing in parallel*: Review of the ostream reducer of Cilk Plus to implement thread-safe printing

The details of each problem are available [here](problems.pdf)
